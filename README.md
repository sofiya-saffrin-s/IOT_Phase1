NOISE POLLUTION MONITORING


PROJECT DEFINITION
                    The project involves an IoT-based noise monitoring system, consisting of a noise sensor to monitor the noise level, an application to show people the real-time noise level so as to create awareness about noise pollution, and an interface between the sensor and application.
                    
DESIGN THINKING

1)Project objective

             The main objective of this project is to create awareness among people about the increasing noise pollution by using a real-time noise monitoring system and to improve the quality of life.
             
2)IoT sensor design

               Noise sensors can be used to monitor noise levels in public areas such as traffic signals, marketplaces, preaching areas, theatres and so on.
               
3) Noise pollution interface platform
   
               Blynk IoT is an application to prototype, deploy, and remotely manage connected electronic devices at any scale. Blynk IoT can be used to personalize an application for a noise monitoring system based on our preferences.
   
4)Integration approach

                     The sensor and application can be interfaced using microcontrollers such as ESP-32 which provides Wi-Fi facility to interact with the mobile application.
